When I first started teaching myself how to code, which I happen to distinguish from programming, I wanted to learn everything as fast as possible so I could proudly call myself a coder. There was a big problem with that, you can't rush it and ultimately, there is just too much to know which is why it's important to take your time. This became evident when I tried to learn React Native. I went through the tutorial and was checking off every concept through each video but the truth was that I wasn't comprehending fully what I was doing but even more, your brain can retain only so much information. My impatience had me go through 2-3 hours worth of videos in a day, which you know if you have done tutorials, you multiply that by atleast three because you are constantly stopping, rewinding, and looking up topics you need clarification. This then gets compounded when you haven't studied the basics.

React Native is built off of the principles and mechanics of React as the name implies and I hadn't bothered to ease my way in and instead was learning React Native without learning React first. Goes without saying that I failed at building the app that the tutorial since I didn't understand the fundamentals to debug code syntax that was deprecated. That is not to say React Native is an easy language, it's not to me atleast but React does have a complex ecosystem which includes the state manager, Redux, which to some is another beast to learn.

So what has changed today for me? I feel like I'm a good coder as I can pick up pretty much any language if given enough time but I still have a ways to become a good programmer. Learning program design and understanding the efficiency of every line of code comes with experience and yes it test my patience because I want to be good today but I also know that trying to rush progress robs me of those moments many of us get when a concept finally clicks.

Today, I am learning to take React slowly and understanding how it works. I try to keep the videos to 15 minutes at most a day because that gives me the time to digest what I have learned and really take the time to fully understand something as basic as props. Props use to completely bewilder me, even just seeing the word would induce confusion. Yes React has a lot to learn, but you don’t need to know much to build an app and that is exactly what I am doing. My wife and I thought of a website we’d like to create so each day I take a little time to add another feature which is hard considering I’m also in school and work full time. Just working 10 minutes on it, knowing I’m building it in React is pretty gratifying, especially when I can visualize all the moving pieces in my head and how they interact with each other.

This is obviously not exclusive to coding but since for me, that is what I love doing, this is my journey. It’s true, patience is a virtue, but I want it now! I want to be great now, I want to build amazing apps and tools. I have to remind myself how much better the quality of my learning is by slowing down and it helps to be more deliberate about my choices. I look back at a year ago or even two years ago and I have definitely grown. I have to focus on my own marathon and not worry about my fellow racers, even when there are so many amazing developers doing amazing projects and collaborating. I am proud of where I am, but I always see more and that is the direction I am heading.
