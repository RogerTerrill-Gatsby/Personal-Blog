So tomorrow is the official start of my bachelors and it's going to happen so fast. I'm excited and anxious but with getting the first couple of assignments out the way, its helped ease into it. My cohort seems pretty awesome actually and already we have helped each other so much. This definitely a great start. I feel like great things are going to happen soon and this will be what I need to propel me to that level. 

It can't be understated that it is never too late to make yourself a better person and with going back and earning my AS in Computer Science and now finishing this chapter starting towards my bachelors, it feels amazing. Sure, I wish I would have done this sooner in life but sometimes you have to go through life to learn what is necessary and what your calling is.
