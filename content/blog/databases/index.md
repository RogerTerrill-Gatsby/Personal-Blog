So everyday I think it’s the best lesson I have learned there comes a new lesson and this time it was databases. Not only did I learn databases but I learned the difference between SQL and NoSQL which to me is simply the difference between tables and objects. Now I know someone will probably yell at me for making it that simple but it helps me to understand it, so tough.

So what did I create this time, it was a camping site that shows pics of camp sites with a title and details page as well. With a form we added items and learned about the RESTful architecture which was always puzzling to me as well but now understanding that it’s a set of rules for how a website is structured is just awesome. It makes life easier for developers which is definitely a philosophy I try to live by but I got a lot of coding from even a year ago to clean up to follow this way of thinking. Back to databases, well now I know what all those strings of numbers and characters are on the url that just seem arbitrary, they are database element unique ids! I swear, even though I’m far from being NEO, everyday it’s like I see snippets of code around me and this truly has been like going down the rabbit hole. This definitely confirmed that I will create my wife’s next project for her movies in MongoDB.

Oh to top this all off, I apparently have been learning a stack that I had no idea, MEAN! Which I was actually really excited about. My journey continues and the next project is working on building a blog site which I’m actually excited over because I might just move this blog over to a website I create for me as a portfolio of sorts. Waiting to get to the authentication section first so as to have a public and private space on it. I’ll then deploy it on Heroku once I learn how to do that as well. So much to learn.
