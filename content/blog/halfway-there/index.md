So yesterday finally did my last class, a simple history class and that means soon enough I’ll get my first degree, Associates of Science in Computer Science which at first didn’t think it was that big of a deal. This is only half way to my next goal of a bachelors but then again it’s probably only a quarter of the way to that PhD. Right now I await my status on whether I’ll get accepted to my first and only choice for school. It really is a brutal waiting game but so be it. That is all for now.
