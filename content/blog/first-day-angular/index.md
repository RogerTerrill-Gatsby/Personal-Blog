Started off a little touch but the day ended up turning around after listening to Javascript Jabber and hearing about codeschool. I started with Pluralsight with Angular: Getting Started and that was a no go because I don’t learn well with starting in the middle and not knowing how pieces come together. I reverted back to the Angular docs which were another failure as I got stuck once I got to services. I was using Cloud9 as my ide but after googling Angular Online IDE I found StackBlitz.com and the heavens opened. Granted you don’t use the Angular CLI but I can always go back to learn that afterwards, right now I just want to know how Angular file structure works and how it comes together which for the most part I have with the help of Codeschool’s video Angular Accelerated which I would highly recommend to new users of any framework.

One huge thing I learned, CSS is scoped to your component, WHAT!, that was amazing to me. Second, there is a lot of different syntax but adding logic to your html was also amazing. That’s it for today.
