After going through the codeschool I can definitely say that the Pluralsight videos Angular: Getting Started clicked. I now am able to follow a lot easier with in stackblitz.com and recreate any components as needed as well as add any dependencies. I learned about directives are nothing more than custom elements and interpolation, which I think sounds fancy as hell, is nothing more than using double curlies to bring in data from a class and it’s respective property. This might not be so bad after all but this is only the beginning. Yesterday I felt like I’d never learn this, today was a different day.
