So I have no idea where this will go but figured maybe I should chronicle my journey with learning frameworks which has already been quite a challenge. I was so excited about getting to know some of the weird parts of Javascript like prototype chain and closures that I felt extremely powerful, even if I hadn’t used them for anything in production. As I started reading job post I realized the new hotness is frameworks and naturally the next question was which one, I heard angular was a good one so I chose that one on no more than hearing a lot about it. I realized that what use to be marketable has grown exponentially and I have quite the gap to fill in my skillset. Angular has definitely challenge the way I think about programming and upon asking some great online resources, I am not alone in thinking this way which brought me some comfort.

As I grow and become more familiar with angular I’ll do quick snippets of what I have learned whenever I can. I’m not a writer so grammar nazis beware as I am a serial grammar destroyer.
