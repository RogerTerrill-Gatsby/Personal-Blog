So I finished my first tutorial on Pluralsight and I finished with feeling 80% comfortable with Angular which is a far more than I was starting this journey. Sometimes it all feels overwhelming though because just the other way I saw another tool, “Help build Angular Apps with…”. I don’t even remember what it was but it was a moment of, wait what, now there is another tool and seriously, everyday there is some other buzzword that I can’t even understand how new things get built everyday.

Anyways, what did I learn about Angular. So to begin with I have a rough understanding about everything but I know the way to truly get a grasp is to build my own project which I am trying to figure out what that project is so we’ll see. I always had interest in many things and could never decide what I enjoyed doing more and then decided on being a developer and guess what, the branches are endless so I guess I didn’t solve my problem. What you are suppose to learn is an ever elusive target but like I constantly hear and read, pick something and stick with it. So what am I sticking with…I wish I knew. Right now it’s Angular which is actually pretty awesome. Actually, there is an overarching language I am sticking with…JAVASCRIPT! I’ve actually grown to love that language and will constantly try to one day become fluent in it. I do understand closures and the prototype chain so I consider that a win.
