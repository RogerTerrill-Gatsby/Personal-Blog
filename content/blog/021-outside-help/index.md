I believe I have said before that this could possibly be a monumental task for one developer to build a full stack ecommerce solution from scratch but it could possibly be a great opportunity for a great accomplishment. Still, I find myself completely confused on which direction to go which led me to reach for help. Over a year ago I went to a hackathon at a company name AutoGravity which I believe did vehicle loans. I met a couple of people there and one was one of their developers who was teaching about using Git. It was a great night but the main thing I got was joining a Slack group that helps veterans with programming and getting jobs which I found to be amazing. It wasn't just for veterans though as anyone could join and he asked me to join so I did. At the time especially, I didn't feel like my skills were at a place where I could actually help them but nonetheless, I joined and they were so welcoming. I mostly just lurk but everyone once in a while I try to contribute even if it's just advice. Fast forward to today and the amazing place that is [Operation Code](https://operationcode.org) would be my goto this time on Slack once again into an arbitrary question I had that was clarified quickly but I made one comment on how I didn't really understand the server side vs client side rendering and who of all people, without hesitation, volunteered to call me the next day and really break it down, the same guy I met at the hackathon, Kyle. 

Kyle no longer works at AutoGravity and actually moved to Oregon but he actually remembered me once I put an avatar on my slack account. The next day he calls me and he begins discussing some of the differences between both methods of building a website and I didn't understand one hundred percent but I learned enough to really dive deeper into certain technologies. We finished the conversation with him suggesting I used GatsbyJS which I had tried in the past and found it to be pretty difficult but I lacked a very important foundation at the time, knowing React. Now with Kyle's guidance I had a better direction so back to Gatsby it was but before I wanted to vet out everything he said, not because I didn't trust him, more because I wanted to truly understand all the advice, he gave me. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoscwJ6MGsU) summed up perfectly what he actually told me which once again, verified Gatsby was the way to go. 

A word on deciding, I actually didn't know that Create-React-App, NextJS, and GatsbyJS related in any way but once I figured that out, it was pretty amazing. One other thing he clarified was to learn GraphQL because it is an important technology which I then decided too. I actually won a book "Learning GraphQL" at another hackathon so I've been using that as a reference. 

Ultimately, understand that even if you are a sole web developer, you are never really alone, the web development community is so helpful and are always willing to help but you have to ask for the help and put in work on your own to clarify anything you are still confused over. Currently, working on building my jobs new ecommerce site from the ground up but with this advice, I'm hoping it creates a solid foundation.
