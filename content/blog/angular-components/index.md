title: Confusing but glorious Angular Components and Http

So my journey continues with Angular and we got to nested components which was great and all but what was amazing…two way binding between components! You mean I can send data from a nested component to the parent and back…what!? This mechanism is executed with the @input and @Output keywords. Oh yeah, one thing to keep in mind, I might not always be write with my terminology or even how I have understood a concept so corrections are always encouraged, even from my future self.

So what else have I learned since last time, services and dependency injections which I am not entirely clear on why they are used but I think it’s because it makes it possible to share it with any module from a centralized point. Maybe that is a topic I will have to go back and rewatch which seemed to have worked pretty well for the next module which really confused me.

Http already sounds like a complex topic but I think words make us uncomfortable by the mere sound of them. A week ago, words like interpolation and directives would have freaked me out. My wife would tell you that one morning I woke up and looked at her and said, “Baby, I sound smart, I know what interpolation and directives are.” She of course gave me a look like I was crazy but sometimes it just feels good understanding something that not long ago was scary.

One final thing, JS promises. My wife read a book that talks about how in our sleep our mind is still solving problems for us, hence sleep on it. Well it worked for promises for me. I watched a youtube video by one of my favorite youtube teachers on JS, @techsith1. He starts a lot of topics with a very simple example to make it clear what the mechanism is doing. The concept that made promises clear to me was what it is used to prevent, the Pyramid of Doom. Last night I thought about it and the lightbulb, oh, it prevents, if then then that, but only if this then that and so on. Prevent the bottom at all cost.
