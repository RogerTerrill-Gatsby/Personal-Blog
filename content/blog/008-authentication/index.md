It has been a minute since I wrote my last post but partly because I took a vacation. It was definitely needed. I actually wrote a post before but just never published it about the difficulties of being your worst enemy when it comes to how hard you can be on yourself, maybe I’ll post it later. Back to authentication though.

Sometimes, looking at programming as if you are building a house is really useful because the carpenter doesn’t need to know how to build a hammer, he just has to know how to use it. This can be the same for being a programmer especially when it comes to security. The last thing you want to do is build a poor tool and with Passport, you don’t have to worry about building poor authentication. While going through “The Web Development Bootcamp” course, I found that it use to have authentication built from scratch but removed it for security reasons which makes complete sense since you don’t want to miss even one character and create a security hole. Again, you don’t want to be the one creating the 2x4s only to find one had one of those holes in it that made it weak, maybe not the best analogy, but I’m not the architect, that is my smarter wife.

So back to the amazing library that is Passport. Upon going through what it does, it all clicked how all these companies use different social media platforms to login. Now I don’t think Passport is the exclusive one but that doesn’t matter to me, at least now I know where it comes from. I remember when I first got into developing, I thought I had to know how to build everything from scratch, what a relief it has been that is not the case. I do have to say though, I have definitely been intrigued to one day become knowledgeable enough to help on one of these security projects. Still looking to be part of the open source community so security might just be it but I’m not there yet.

So what do I use Passport for? Well simply it was just registering for my site and logging back in with that same password that was saved in the database, obviously not plain text but with a hash and sha1. Again, learning all the magic tricks is what keeps me coming back to learn more, still amazing learning all of this.
